## _Major collaborations_

* 2014-present - *MESA project* <br>
[The Modules for experiments in Astrophysics (MESA)][mesadocs] software
instrument is the most widely used tool to model stellar evolution. This is an open
source project of which I am one of the main developers, as well as the lead developer
of its binary evolution module and one of 4 members of its technical council. I also act
as curator of the [public repository][zenodo] where results and input files to reproduce published
work is posted by users.
* 2020-present - *XShootU* <br>
International collaboration working on the data aquired by the Ultraviolet
Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program of the
Hubble space telescope together with complementary data from the XSHOOTER
instrument of the VLT. I am a member
of its working group on stellar evolution ([WG5][xshootu]).
