I'm Pablo Marchant (full name Pablo Ignacio Marchant Campos) a Chilean born
astronomer currently working as an FWO junior postdoctoral fellow at the Institute
of Astronomy of KU Leuven. My main interest is in theoretical stellar evolution, and I've
done significant work on the study of single and binary massive star evolution. One of my main scientific
interests concerns the formation pathways of gravitational wave sources. The main tool for
my work is the [MESA][MESA] open source instrument for stellar evolution, of which I'm one of the main developers.
