I also act as curator of the [public repository][zenodo] where results and input files to reproduce published work is posted by users.
* 2020-present - **XShootU**\
    International collaboration working on the data aquired by the Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program of the Hubble space telescope together with complementary data from the XSHOOTER instrument of the VLT. I am the head of its working group on stellar evolution ([WG5][xshootu]).

## _Talks and presentations_

For talks listed below, name of the contribution is given first followed by the event. Copies of the slides for all talks are provided, although I usually
design them to work in conjunction with me actually speaking. So things can be lost if looking at them as stand-alone documents (a few have online recordings though).
