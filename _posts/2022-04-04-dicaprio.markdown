Funny thing that happened earlier this year, Di Caprio describing a figure I made for a MESA paper as 
next-generation cutting-edge technology. Thanks to Jared Goldberg for noticing this one! The source of the Figure is from the
[third MESA instrument paper][mesaIII], and deals with code comparison between the MESA and STARS codes. So slightly
off-topic with the subject of the movie.
