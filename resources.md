## _Thesis work_

During my education I had to write three theses, one for my undergrad, one for my masters, and the last one
for my PhD. You can download those down here, earlier ones are a curious retrospective on how I wrote at a much junior stage.
- [PhD thesis](../assets/docs/PhD_thesis.pdf):\
    _"The impact of tides and mass transfer on the evolution of metal-poor massive binary stars"_\
    ADS entry [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PhDT.......434M/abstract)
- [Master thesis](../assets/docs/Master_thesis.pdf):\
    _"Evolution of axially symmetric magnetic fields in neutron star crusts due to the Hall drift"_,\
    results were published as [Marchant et al. (2015)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...796...94M/abstract)
- [Undergrad thesis](../assets/docs/Undergrad_thesis.pdf):\
    _"Large-scale instabilities of poloidal magnetic fields in stars"_\
    results were published as [Marchant et al. (2011)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.415.2426M/abstract)

## _Teaching Material_

### GW astrophysics

These are the slides for a series of lectures I made on 2021 at KU Leuven as part of the course
"high energy astrophysics". These are not meant to go deep into GR, but rather get an overview of
what is measured by current detectors.

- [Part 1](../assets/docs/2022/GW_part1.pdf): Overview
- [Part 2](../assets/docs/2022/GW_part2.pdf): Ground based interferometers
- [Part 3](../assets/docs/2022/GW_part3.pdf): GWs from compact binaries
- [Part 4](../assets/docs/2022/GW_part4.pdf): Parameter estimation
- [Part 5](../assets/docs/2022/GW_part5.pdf): Astrophysics of observed GW sources

### Ordinary differential equations

After repeatedly being a teaching assistant for the course on ordinary differential equations
at my university in Chile, I wrote down a set of notes including a summary of 
the covered material together with sets of problems with solutions. I know these
these were still in use after I left, so in case someone else might find them
useful they can be downloaded [here](../assets/docs/2022/Ecuaciones_Diferenciales.pdf). Just
one warning, these are in spanish!

## _Illustrations_

I often like to invest time making nice looking figures to illustrate my work. Although I am a bit critical
of how they look, people seem to like them :). So here are a few. Some of these have come up on papers, some other on
proposals. SVG files are provided here, so feel free to take specific parts to make something different.

## _Nicer Illustrations_

Also my wife (Sara Pinilla) has helped produce what I consider to be much prettier illustrations. You can find some
of these below, if you like them and would like to use them, just be sure to credit her. Interpretation of what each
image represents is up to the viewer!
