## _Illustrations_

I often like to invest time making nice looking figures to illustrate my work. Although I am a bit critical
of how they look, people seem to like them :). So here are a few. Some of these have come up on papers, some other on
proposals. SVG files are provided here, so feel free to take specific parts to make something different.

- Evolution of a massive overcontact binary system leading to a binary black hole. Part of [Marchant et al. (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...604A..55M/abstract).

- Evolution of a close massive binary leading to a ULX. Part of [Marchant et al. (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...604A..55M/abstract).

- Illustration of various evolutionary channels leading to a merging binary black hole. Figure from a proposal.

- Formation of a binary black hole from common envelope and chemically homogeneous evolution, with potential pulsational pair-instability supernovae in between.
Part of [Marchant et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...882...36M/abstract).

## _Nicer Illustrations_

Also my wife (Sara Pinilla) has helped produce what I consider to be much prettier illustrations. You can find some
of these below, if you like them and would like to use them, just be sure to credit her. Interpretation of what each
image represents is up to the viewer!
